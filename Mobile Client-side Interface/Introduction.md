## 1. INTRODUCTION

The Internet's increasing importance for various activities has driven a digital transformation, especially in banking and e-commerce, with online transactions becoming a key service for both personal and business customers (Diener & Špaček, 2021). While this digital shift makes banking and online purchases more convenient, it has also created new risks. Criminals are developing more sophisticated ways to steal banking information through techniques like phishing scams, malware, and social engineering attacks (Adedoyin Tolulope Oyewole et al., 2024). Recent statistics from Caitlin (2024) indicate that approximately 3.4 billion phishing emails are sent daily, with Ozsahan & Worthington (2024) reporting that phishing is the leading initial attack vector, responsible for 41% of security incidents. This alarming trend underscores the critical need for robust security measures to protect sensitive banking information, as noted in Manoharan & Sarker (2024).

Banking information theft methods have evolved significantly, Initially, attackers relied on basic phishing emails, which were often easy to spot due to their generic content and poor formatting. However, with technological advancements, cybercriminals have adopted more sophisticated techniques, such as spear phishing, which targets specific individuals or organizations, and advanced malware such as banking Trojans (Gashi, 2023). Shaukat et al. (2023) examine how machine learning algorithms detect these evolving threats, while Heiding (2024) highlights AI's role in crafting convincing phishing content, making attacks harder to identify. A notable example is the TrickBot banking Trojan, which according to Galindo Quintana (2022), has transformed from a simple credential stealer to a multi-modular malware capable of spreading across networks and performing various malicious activities, illustrating the complexity of modern threats.

As threats continue to become more complex, the importance of client-side detection methods has taken centre stage. Unlike server-side detection, which depends on the organization's infrastructure, client-side strategies work directly on a user's device, delivering instant warnings and swift reactions to possible risks (Chanakya et al., 2024). Ali et al. (2022) highlight the use of ML-based approaches for detecting phishing websites and emails, emphasizing the potential for client-side detection to enhance user protection. This approach eases the pressure on organization infrastructures while adding an extra shield against attacks that might slip past server-side protections, a point reinforced by studies exploring how suspicious patterns in web forms, domain names, and site content can be flagged (Burbela, 2023; Kansagara et al., 2021). This is particularly crucial given the increasing sophistication of attacks, where traditional server-side measures may fall short.

Despite technological advancements, real-time threat detection in online transactions remains a significant challenge (Patel, 2023). The speed at which cyberattacks occur necessitates highly efficient detection systems, as highlighted by Kessler (2024) in their analysis of digital banking fraud. The adaptability of attack techniques, especially those leveraging AI and ML, requires continuous updating of detection systems to keep up with new threats (Roshanaei et al., 2024). Thus, this study aims to build an intelligent client-side interface integrated with ML that can detect banking information theft on the client.

## 2. Problem Statement

The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly changed how people bank and transact, with more customers choosing online services over visiting physical banks (Szili et al., 2022). As people stayed home to avoid contracting COVID-19, the use of digital banking increased substantially, with the number of online banking customers worldwide rising by 30% as of April 2020 (Statista, 2024), while this shift has been beneficial for banks, ecommerce merchants and clients, it has also led to a rise in cybercrime, with criminals increasingly targeting digital banking customers through phishing attacks that can result in financial losses (Alzoubi et al., 2022).

The incidents of banking information theft have emerged as a critical security challenge in the digital landscape (Alzoubi et al., 2022). In 2020, phishing attacks increased by more than 220% compared to the previous year (David, 2020), with attackers using deceptive techniques like deploying fraudulent website forms to steal sensitive client information (Sánchez-Paniagua et al., 2022). Phishing attacks remain challenging to detect, as phishing websites and emails are closely mimicking legitimate ones, making it difficult for users to identify the difference and to avoid being deceived (Bashir et al., 2020). This situation underscores the need for dynamic, browser-level detection of phishing content in real-time (Wayburn, 2024). To address the highlighted problem, this study focuses on developing an intelligent system for real-time, client-side detection of phishing attempts to safeguard banking information against evolving cyber threats.
