Web-basedfingerprinting, a particular case of device fingerprinting, allows website owners to differentiate devices basedon the set of information that browsers transmit. Depending on the techniques being used, a website can tracka device based on its browser features (browser fingerprinting) or based on system settings (cross-browserfingerprinting). The latter allows identification of the device even when more than one browser is used.Several different works have introduced new techniques over the last years proving that fingerprinting can bedone in multiple ways, but there is not a consolidated work gathering all of them. The current work identifiesknown web-based fingerprinting techniques, categorizing them as which ones are browser and which arecross-browser and showing real examples of the data that can be captured with each technique. The study issynthesized in a taxonomy, which provides a clear separation between techniques, making it easier to identifythe threats to security and privacy inherent to each one.}, booktitle = {Proceedings of the 13th International Joint Conference on E-Business and Telecommunications}, pages = {271â€“282}, numpages = {12}, keywords = {Browser Fingerprinting, Cross-browser Fingerprinting, Device Fingerprinting, Fingerprint., Privacy}, location = {Lisbon, Portugal}, series = {ICETE 2016}
