# Ideas for exploration

This document contains a list of ideas members would like to explore in the project
## Real-Time Anomaly Detection
* How to Implement streaming analytics or complex event processing to analyse transactions as they occur
## Geolocation Intelligence
* Correlate transaction location with the cardholder's known whereabouts.
* Investigate using IP geolocation for online transactions
## Phonetic Matching Algorithms
* Soundex: This algorithm assigns a code based on the first letter and following consonants in a word. Websites with similar Soundex codes could be flagged for further investigation.
* Metaphone: This algorithm goes beyond the first letter, considering vowel sounds as well. It could be more accurate than Soundex.
## Other Considerations
* Visual Similarity: Explore techniques to identify websites with logos or visual elements that mimic legitimate brands.
* Content Analysis: Analyze the content of a website (text, images) to identify inconsistencies or suspicious language that might indicate fraud.
* Real-time Detection: Integrate techniques with browser security features to provide users with real-time warnings when visiting potentially fraudulent websites.
##User empowerment strategies
* Browser Extension: Develop a browser extension that analyzes the phonetics of a website domain when a user visits it. It could highlight potential risks and offer comparison tools to legitimate sites.
